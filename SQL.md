### 3. SQL query to find third highest salary in company
The most simple way that should work in any database is to do following:

```sql
SELECT * FROM `employee` ORDER BY `salary` DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```

Which orders employees by salary and then tells db to return a single result (1 in LIMIT) counting from third row in result set (2 in OFFSET). It may be OFFSET 3 if your DB counts result rows from 1 and not from 0.

This example should work in MySQL and PostgreSQL.
